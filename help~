karma throws error if we change existing folder structure ?
how to make it check for new folder structure ?
change entry in karm-conf.js  /media/harish/storage/code/javascript/angularjs/icss/karma.conf.js

for ex. i deleted bower_components folder but this karma_conf.js had these file  list so it was flinging errors 
so i removed the following

      'app/bower_components/angular/angular.js',
      'app/bower_components/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js',
      'app/bower_components/angular-resource/angular-resource.js',
      'app/bower_components/angular-cookies/angular-cookies.js',
      'app/bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.js',
      'app/bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js'

in that file don't give /*.js then it loads file in some random order and complains as angular not defined .
so give explicit names
for eg see in  // list of files / patterns to load in the browser karma-conf.js 
and change 'app/scripts/**/*.js', to explicti ones as
'app/scripts/lib/jquery/jquery.js',
      'app/scripts/lib/angular/angular.js',
      'app/scripts/lib/angular-route/angular-route.js',
      'app/scripts/lib/bootstrap/bootstrap.js',
      'app/scripts/lib/angular-strap/angular-strap.js',
